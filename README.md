Implementation of an alert detection system in a distributed wireless sensor network.
- Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used for communication between nodes and the base station.  

- The system simulates a Tsunami detection system, by analysing average water height levels and reporting anomalous high readings to a base station for human analysis  

- In addition, threads will be used for simulating the data generated by the satellite altimeter.  

More details of this project can be found in the report.
